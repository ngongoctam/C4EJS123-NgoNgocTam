    <p>"Mary Oliver is saving my life,"Paul Chowder, the title  character of Nicholson Bakers novel"<a href="#">The Anthologist,</a>" scrawls in the margins of Oliver's <a href="#">"New and Selected Poems, Volume One."</a> A struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case off writer's block. His girlfriend, with whom he's lived for eight year, hass just left him, ostensibly because he has been unable to write the long -overdue introduction to a poetry anthology that he has been putting together. For solace and inspiration, he turn to poet who have his touchstones- Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke,Sara Teasdale-before discovering Oliver. In her work, he finds consolation:"I immediately felt more sure of what i was doing." Of her poems, he says, "They're very simple. And yet each has something."</p>

        I don't know exactly what a prayer is.<br>
        I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down<br>
        into the grass , how to kneel down in the grass,<br>
        how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,<br>
        which is what I have been doing all day.
    </ul>

    <p>
        The cadences are almost Biblical. "Attention is the beginning of devotion," she urges elsewhere.<br>
